⚔️ RPG Game

@2024 Calin Mihai-Catalin

The primary purpose of this RPG game is to provide an engaging and interactive experience where players can equip items, fight enemies, and customize their character's stats. As you progress through the game, you can equip different types of gear (helmets, pants, weapons, etc.), which will modify your character’s attributes, such as Health Points (HP) and Attack Power (AP).

Given that the game is still under development, expect regular updates and improvements as new features are added and bugs are fixed. The game may also require adjustments for future compatibility with new Python versions or libraries.
